Hello there! I am a second year doctoral student at the Affective Computing Lab at the University of South Florida
under the supervision of [Prof. Shaun Canavan](https://www.csee.usf.edu/~scanavan/). I specialize
in Affective Computing, which is a branch in Computer Science that deals with developing tools to perform human behaviour analysis. I am currently pursuing my Masters + PhD in
Computer Science from the
[University *of* South Florida](https://www.usf.edu/) and I received my
B.E. in Computer Science and Engineering from [Visveraya Technological University](https://vtu.ac.in/).

 My research interests include:
  * **Affective Computing**: Analysing affective components in humans which includes emotions, expressions, action units using various modalities.
  * **Computer Vision/Representation Learning**: Utilizing the capabilites of flow-based models to explore the latent space of the affective components.
  * **Biometrics**: Continuous authentication and facial recognition of mobile users.
