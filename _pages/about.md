Hello there! I am a fourth year doctoral student at the Affective Computing Lab at the University of South Florida
under the supervision of [Prof. Shaun Canavan](https://www.csee.usf.edu/~scanavan/). I specialize
in Affective Computing, which is a branch in Computer Science that deals with developing tools to perform human behaviour analysis. I am currently pursuing my Masters + PhD in
Computer Science from the
[University *of* South Florida](https://www.usf.edu/) and I received my
B.E. in Computer Science and Engineering from [Visveraya Technological University](https://vtu.ac.in/).

 My research interests include:
  * **Affective Computing**: Analysing affective components in humans which includes emotions, expressions, action units using various modalities. The downstream application includes reflective thinking and PTSD analysis.
  * **Representation Learning**: Utilizing the capabilites of flow-based models to explore the latent space of the affective components. The downstream applications is extended to out-of-distribution recognition and facial expression recognition
  * **Biometrics**: Face verification on large-scale dataset and Continuous authentication of mobile users.
